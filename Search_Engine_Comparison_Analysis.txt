Search Engine Evaluation (DuckDuckGo compared to Google)

I was assigned to examine the search results for DuckDuckGo. This search engine performed worse compared to Google.
The average percent overlap is 21.5% and the average Spearman coefficient is -9.295 (rounded to 4 significant digits).
Having a 21.5% overlap basically means that, for every 10 results compared between each Google and DuckDuckGo, only about 2 results
would appear to overlap on average, regardless of the result rank. This shows that the algorithm that DuckDuckGo uses underperformed
when querying the same things as Google. Moreover, since the Spearman coefficient is negative,
that means that the ranks of results given by DuckDuckGo is dissimilar to the ranks of the results given by Google on average.
Since the Spearman coefficient is low, this means that the observations have a dissimilar rank.
Using google as a search engine standard, I conclude that DuckDuckGo performed worse compared to Google.
